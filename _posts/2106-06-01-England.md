England was just a blur as I rushed to the edge-of-London office where ArciTech was imprisoned. But on my way back, trying to look confident and normal wheeling her box behind me, I take my time to look around. I realize something: England is strange.
 
There are the things I expected: the iconic red gondola trains, the accents, Big Ben. It’s like walking through a film set I’ve seen so many times.
 
But then there are the things that are like home, but shifted. Take the billboards. I walk past the Museum of Most-Contemporary Art, where a poster Überbot’s new film is hanging on the facade. Instead of writing the movie’s name — Sealed with Revenge — these ads say Sealed with Revolution and Überbot isn’t looking nobly into the distance, he’s staring at you.
 
They’ve changed the tagline too.  Not “He’s gone postal” but just “Go postal.”
 
I sit down at the gondola stop to wait for my ride to the airport. And I wait. And wait. A bunch of streets are closed and some gondola lines seem down. Come to think of it, there’s a ton of road repair going on in London. I guess that’s why ArciTech’s construction worker owners located their office here. Still. As I mentally prepare to spend the rest of my languishing on this sidewalk corner, I watch a team of repair bots working across the street. The one closest to me has steamroller arms, and after a few minutes, I realize, he’s just going back and forth over the same, impeccable looking three-foot stretch. They’re not actually fixing anything!
 
I turn to the box I’ve been wheeling, and the calm face visible through the cover window, and I think I have my answer. ArciTech, you sly magician. You’ve caused this.
 
I can’t wait to see what she’s like when she wakes up. Why wait? I open the box and flip the switch to bring her back to life.
