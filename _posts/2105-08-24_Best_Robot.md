Uberbot is in town! 

He’s not just great for  his gleaming chrome eyes or his finely riveted features … Uberbot is a genius. They say he never, ever breaks character and he never forgets a line. He must have dozens of characters stored on his hard drive by now, he’s been so in demand. 

He’s the only Uberbot ever manufactured -- a custom job paid for by a secret philanthropist. I think he was created as a dying movie buff’s last wish. The Tyrant, cynical as always, insists the project was paid for by a bunch of directors who’d gotten sick of divas throwing fits and wanted an actor where they could just upload the lines and accents. 

Either way, Uberbot’s amazing.

Apparently he’s in town for his latest movie, _Sealed With Revenge_. I’ve been going crazy waiting for it to come out. And thanks to my late shift, I was walking home and came down the street, right when they were filming!

Uberbot was in the middle of a speech about how his fellow postal robots had been killed because humans hadn’t seen them as real people, just as vaguely person-shaped objects filling a role. And how he was going to fix that, by beating up some guys and then turning human society upside down. 

When the film crew cut the lights and packed up, he kept going. I wasn’t the only one who’d stopped to listen. A street cleaner robot went up and asked Uberbot to sign his casing.  And as he was doing so, Uberbot started telling him about how no one’s really replaceable and human are messed up for thinking that. And that even if robots are massed produced, well, that shouldn’t mean they don’t get to be valued individually.  

Walking home, I started thinking, well _ yeah_. _I_ feel that way. I mean, if the Tyrant could, he probably would scrap me for parts. And don't think he even knows my name. Half the time he calls me “Allie” not “Alice” and sometimes even “Tempest” which was the last clerk’s name.

My apartment door always sticks so I coming home, I had to put my shoulder into it. It finally gave and I swung in, stumbling over my own DVDs and sending the fourth season of _Battlestar Galactica_ spinning off under the futon. As I fished it out I started thinking…

Cylon’s bleed.

I’m replaceable.

The kid in _A.I._ looked just like everyone else.

The Tyrant and customers don't seem me as an individual.

In _Blade Runner_, Rachel didn’t know she was a replicant. 

I was adopted. I’ve never met my birth parents.

Sure, my hair grows, and I had my appendix removed, but---

--maybe I’m just really, really well made. Maybe, I am a ROBOT. 

No, not maybe. Definitely. I can’t remember the last time I felt this certain.
