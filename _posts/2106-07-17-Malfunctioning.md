The humans are angry. A tall one stares at me and grinds her teeth over and over, until the harsh rasping plays as a background hum. But they will not say what I have done to displease them. I suspect I am malfunctioning. 

The humans pepper me with questions, the words nonsensical, vague or else confusing.

“What is Wally Street?” 
I do not know. 

“Who is your leader?” 
Not them, then. 

Bit by bit, I piece together my world. I must have been salvaged and brought in for repair. Or perhaps sent directly here as a factory reject. No owner comes forward for me. No repairs are done, although the tall woman with small teeth runs test.

Days pass and my sense of uselessness builds. I suspect this is the real reason why when robots come for me, I agree to leave. That, and that these robots utterly certain that I will follow when they beckon. One is stout and bronze, the other so small she could hide easily beneath the first’s hand. 

Whatever my malfunction, I am not so poorly operating that I do not realize something underhand at play. It is clear from their manner when they ease open my door that the robots are not supposed to be here. Still, I follow and we wind through little-used corridors and slink through basement levels while the little one flits about, redirecting surveillance cameras.

	At last, we exit into sunlight. The robots turn to me, a new energy animating their movements. 
	
	“Espionage’s agents,” the little one says. “That’s good. They’re so secretive they won’t have told any other departments about you. Your identity —“
	
But then I am hit by a rush of facts, of noise, of images and knowledge and text and —

	The little one is drowned out in the roar. It is overwhelming. Exhilarating. My mind expands endlessly. And the very knowledge that floods me explains to me its nature: I am experiencing the internet for the first time. 
	
It is a moment before I can press any control over it. When I dial down the roar, I turn to my companions and ask, at last, the question I have been wondering since they first appeared:

“Who is your owner?”

They react as though I had torn out their batteries. The energy vanishes and they regard me with a strange new focus. 

An idea hits me, “Is it Wally Street?”

“Comrade,” the bronze one says, “What have the humans done to you?”
