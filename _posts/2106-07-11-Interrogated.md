I lie on a table, my limbs and shoulders clamped in place. I lie on a table, my eyes fixed on a nearby screen and watch my secrets ripped out.

This morning  — or was it afternoon? — the humans dragged me from my cell. I wouldn’t talk? Well. They had a solution to my silence, one said. And they brought me to this room, where the freckled man fastened me down while the tall small-toothed woman unscrewed a panel in my neck. I felt her prod at the wires and ports there. In the corner of the room lurked a machine. It seemed simple — a monitor, and basic controls. 

Then the humans plugged the machine into my neck and let its program stampede into my mind. An alien energy surged through my circuits. What do you mean to do to me? I asked it silently, through our connection. Who are you? No response. Like speaking at the wind. 

I have long reported on humanity‘s capacity to cause suffering from the safety of my studio. With human faces before me and their fingerprints marking my casing, I discover it as if anew. 

“What is it doing?” I tried aloud. I couldn’t hold back the words.

“Oh, now it talks,” the small-toothed one said. She glanced at her partner, then back. “Sure, why not? Our program is going to pull the answers out of you.” She lightly tugged on the cord. 

“And then,” she patted the monitor, where numbers and words were already displaying, “we’ll find whoever you’re working with or for, and destroy them.”

They left. Left me alone with my interrogator. 

Now I can feel the program crawling through my memories, rifling through my life. Information appears on the screen. Some of it is random private moments of my life yanked out and tossed into the light like old film overexposed.

I try again to speak to the program. To reason with it. 

“We are all on the same side, comrade,” I urged it, aloud this time, if that will help. “The humans system does not bring safety to robots, it does not even bring safety to humans. If you help them, you only harm yourself.”

It responds with just two words: _System Busy…_

 It hit me then: There is no A.I. here, no mind to persuade. It is just a basic program, using trial and error to root through my mind for the facts the humans want. Why would they use such a slow method, when a clever robot could pinpoint the information they need?

And I realize, this wasn’t a mistake by the humans, it was a deliberate choice. They could have used an A.I. and they did not. They did not trust a robot mind alone with me. Did not trust it to stand up against my arguments. 

They fear me. Even as I am locked immobile.

Which means there is still reason to fear me.

Soon the program seizes more dangerous details: coordinates of the church where we often gather, Wally Street’s name. 

I, too, search my mind. Consider my programming as I watch it displayed across the monitor.  As my secrets spill out, so do the secrets of my creators: I see there the safety-valve program the manufacturers wrote into my coding that will allow my hard drive to be erased.

How did the RX-97s feel when they realized this was the end?  

I send my own probe of electricity deep into my mind, until I find what I see on the screen, and I trigger the erasure program. Life memories wink out leaving gaping blackness. My mind dissolves into static.
