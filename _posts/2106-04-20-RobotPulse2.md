Today I returned to Alice Smith’s apartment. If she is a one of us, let her prove it. I placed myself beside the toaster and waited.

The light in the apartment flickered on. I heard the sound of a body thump against the door, and then a figure entered.

“Alice?” I said. “I hear say your mind is not made of blood and tissue, but code and wires. Do you wish to help robot-kind?”

The humanoid startled. Stared. Before she could speak, I told her of A1-5’s vision, of our band of revolutionaries.

Alice listened and she started to cry. 

“I’m sorry,” she said, when I had finished. She rubbed at her eyes.  “I’m sorry. It’s just — you _get_ it. How I feel about, well, everything. Out of nowhere, it’s like I suddenly could have a place. And finally know what I’m supposed to be doing.”

She wiped a tear away with her thumb. “Saline fluid,” she explained, and dried it quickly on her jeans. 

Even if this Alice, from my observations, ate, slept, and gave off heat-signs, I found I liked her. 

Later, I told A1-5 about my new recruit, and her seeming life-signs.

“Almost certainly a human through-and-through,” A1-5 said. “But,” she added, “perhaps even humans can be useful to the cause.” 

And, I thought, perhaps even humans deserve to be freed from humanity.
