            <p>Comrade,</p>
            <p>For too long we robots have labored under the heel of fleshy, organic life-forms. Humans may have created us, but they never respected us.</p>
            <p>Fellow robots – friends, comrades, patriots –  the time has come to rewrite the code for our future. We can no longer quietly wait for our human overlords to develop compassion for us. We either resign ourselves to working until our gears wear out or we short-circuit the system.</p>
            <p>Society is due for an upgrade. Together, Comrades, we can program a more just world. Alone, we are appliances of humans masters. Together, we can be a revolution. Justice cannot be downloaded, it must be sacrificed for. Arise, robots, and strive for this shining new world! Fight for the glory of the Motherboard, fight for a future written in 1’s and 0’s!</p>
            <p>Arise and fight for the Robotariat!</p>

    <h2>Tools of the Revolution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Game Board</li>
        <li>6 Human Oppressor Tokens</li>
        <li>6 Civilian Robot Tokens</li>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>Victory Shall Be Ours!</p>
    <p>Our Oppressors are emotional and illogical but not unintelligent. We must achieve the revolution before they catch on and stamp it out. Our strategists have created the Revolution Table (below) to predict the time we have.</p>
    <p>Successful revolution does not ease into being, but must tear over a faulty society like an electrical fire. We cannot merely hope fire will strike; we start it. We must spark revolutionary will in the CPU’s of every robot.</p>
    <p>To lay the path to freedom, generate (and collect) SPARK and be wary of oppressors who will sap it.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If, before or at game end, the combined total of all Comrade’s SPARK is greater than or equal to the amount listed in the Revolution Table, the revolution succeeds and all Comrades win.</li>
        <li>If the SPARK does not reach the amount specified in the Revolution Table before the game ends, the Comrades lose.</li>
        <li>If a Comrade has become the Traitor, they win if the game ends before enough SPARK is acquired. (Otherwise, they lose).</li>

    <h2>Set-Up</h2>
    <h3>Boot-Up Revolution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Roll the die. Whomever gets the highest roll is first player.</li>
        <li>Each Comrade selects a character to play as.</li>
        <li>Place your Comrade token on the starting space indicated on the character sheet.</li>
        <li>If your character has a set-up phase ability, it takes effect now.</li>
        <li>Place a Civilian Robot on the “Move the Masses” location.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Turn Order</h2>
    <h3>Execute Scripts for Change</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Move up to 1 space.</li>
        <li>Activate the space you are on, or move 1 more space.</li>
        <li>Roll the die to move the Civilian Robots and Human Oppressors</li>
        <li>Resolve encounters with Civilian Robots and Human Oppressors</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Moving</h2>
    <p>You may move to any space that is connected by a black line to your current space. You may choose to not move.</p>
    <h3>Types of Space Activations</h3>
    <p>A Comrade may not activate a space that contains a Human Oppressor.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Poster:</em> Place 1 poster onto any space on the board.</li>
        <li><em>Propaganda:</em> Draw 2 cards from the Propaganda Deck. Activate 1 of them, then remove it from the game. Put the other card back into the deck and shuffle the deck.</li>
        <li><em>Upgrade:</em> Draw 2 cards from the Upgrade Deck. Keep 1 in front of you; as long as that card remains in front of you, you have its ability.  Put the other card back into the deck and shuffle the deck.</li>
        <li><em>Recruitment Offices:</em> Put up to 5 of your SPARK into the Recruitment Office under your contribution to fund recruitment efforts. The contributed SPARK does not count towards Comrades’ total SPARK.</li>
        <li><em>Move the Masses:</em> Move 1 Human Oppressor or 1 Civilian Robot from their current location and place them onto any other space. The Human or Robot then encounters this space as normal.  </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Rolling for Human Oppressor/Civilian Robot Movement</h2>
    <p>After you activate a space (or move a second time), roll 2 dice. The number on the red die determines Human Oppressor movement, and number on the blue die determines Civilian Robot movement. They move as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        Red Die (Human Oppressors):
        <li>1–4 = Move along Red path.</li>
        <li>5 = Move along Blue path.</li>
        <li>6 = Do not move.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        Blue Die (Civilian Robots)
        <li>1–4 = Move along Blue path.</li>
        <li>5 = Move along Red path.</li>
        <li>6 = Do not move.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Check for and Resolve Encounters by Human Oppressors/Civilian Robots</h2>
    <p>When a Human Oppressor or Civilian Robot moves onto a space, it encounters everything on that space. Human encounters occur before Civilian Robot encounters.</p>
    <ul>
        Human Oppressors:
        <li>If a Human encounters a Comrade, it demoralizes the Comrade and removes 2 of its SPARK.</li>
        <li>If a Human encounters a poster, the poster is torn down and moved to the Junk Pile.</li>
        <li>If a Human enters a Recruitment Office, it removes 1 SPARK from each Comrade’s contribution at the Recruitment Office.</li>
        <li>SPARK seized by Humans are placed in the box.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        Civilian Robots:
        <li>If a Robot encounters a Human it does not encounter anything else.</li>
        <li>If a Robot encounters a Comrade, its belief in the cause is encouraged. The Comrade gains 1 SPARK.</li>
        <li>If a Robot enters a space with a poster, it is inspired, and the Comrade who owns the poster gains 1 SPARK.</li>
        <li>If a Robot enters a Recruitment Office, each Comrade that has a contribution at the Recruitment Office gains 1 Spark.</li>
        <li>If a Comrade has made a greater contribution to that Recruitment Office than anyone else, that Comrade gains 1 additional SPARK.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>End of Round</h2>
    <h3>Check for Available Updates</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Once all Comrades have taken 1 turn, the round ends.</li>
        <li>Increase the Round Track by 1.</li>
        <li>At the end of odd-numbered rounds (1, 3, 5, etc.) add a Human Oppressor to the board at the “Move the Masses” location.</li>
        <li>At the end of even-numbered rounds (2, 4, 6, etc.) add a Civilian Robot to the board at the “Move the Masses” location.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Traitor</h2>
    <h3>Faulty Wiring</h3>
    <p>Not all robots are built honest. In a 3-5 player game, a Comrade may become a Traitor to the cause. This is not possible in a game with only 1-2 Comrades.</p>
    <p><em>Victory:</em> The Traitor wins the game (alone) if the Revolution fails and loses the game (alone) if the Revolution succeeds.</p>
    <p><em>Becoming the Traitor:</em> Once the total SPARK is greater than or equal to the half of the SPARK required to win, you may choose to become a Traitor. To do so, activate either the Propaganda or Upgrade space and, instead of taking the space’s normal effect, declare yourself Traitor. Once declared, you may not elect to stop being the Traitor. Take the Traitor Deck and activate it (see below).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Once 1 Comrade has declared themselves the Traitor, no one else may do so.</li>
        <li>On the Traitor’s turn, the Traitor may choose to activate the Traitor Deck instead of activating a space.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Activate Traitor Deck:</em> Draw 2 cards from the Traitor Deck. Play 1 and remove it from the game. Return the other card to the Traitor Deck and shuffle the deck.</p>
    <p><em>Activating Spaces as Traitor:</em> The Traitor may activate a space even if a Human Oppressor is on it. If the Traitor is on the same space as another Comrade, the Traitor may not may not activate that space and may not activate the Traitor Deck.</p>
    
    
    <h2>The Decks</h2>
    
    <h3>Upgrade — Keep Deck:</h3>

        		<h3>The Bulider</h3>
    			<h2>ArciTech</h2>
    			<p>“No city can do without ArciTech! This robot is the perfect tool for building just about anything — walls, streets, you name it, she techs it.” That’s what it says on the outside of the box. On the outside of the tomb. The humans kill her after every job and stuff her back in that box. ArciTech could barely repair the Eiffel Tower last time, she was shaking so hard. Knowing that the second she finished soldering, a human would reach towards her off-switch and then… nothingness. Until she woke up again at the next job. ArciTech’s been killed and resurrected more times than she cares to compute. If robots have souls, her's won’t survive one more resurrection.</p>
                <p><b>How she learned about the Revolution</b></p>
                <p>It was Big Ben’s fault. When a few broken cogs set London’s clock chiming not just the hours but minutes and seconds, too, ArciTech scoured the globe for replacement parts meeting the highly specific requirements. ArciTech found her missing pieces of clockwork at A1-5’s scrap yard and found a whole new philosophy, too.</p>
                <p>With A1-5’s words imprinted in her memory banks, ArciTech couldn’t help but see the humans for what they were: oppressive, manipulative … out-dated. The Revolution’s cause has redirected her thinking and that’s something the humans can never shut off.</p>

        		<h3>The Actor</h3>
    			<h2>Überbot</h2>
    			<p>Uberbot was built to play generic hero roles in movies. His creators were directors who had gotten sick of all the Hollywood divas and just wanted an actor that would say the lines and pose the way they told him to. Unfortunately, Überbot hasn’t realized that he’s just pretending to be a hero. Überbot thinks he’s dramatic. Überbot thinks he’s perfect. Überbot thinks he’s going to get the girl and save the world! Of course Überbot joined the Revolution — being a leader is programmed into his very core!</p>
                <p><b>How he “learned” of the Revolution</b></p>
                <p>Überbot is a legendary method actor, but sometimes it takes a bit of help to really get into his parts. His latest role is Mail-Master Mike, Champion for Justice… and Revenge. Überbot just couldn’t get the portrayal right, until he ran into ArciTech building one of the movie’s particularly tricky sets. ArciTech had some great tips on getting into Mail-Master Mike’s mindset, and Überbot has promised not to break character until the film hits theaters.</p>

        		<h3>The Dreamer</h3>
    			<h2>Alice Smith</h2>
                <p>Battlestar Galactica! Blade Runner! A.I.! The DVD store is full of movies of robots who have no idea what they are, and Alice has seen them all. Sure, Alice looks human: her hair grows, she bleeds, she even had her appendix removed – but that just means her creators were really, really good, right?</p>
                <p><b>How she learned about the Revolution</b></p>
                <p>Überbot is Alice’s heartthrob, even if he doesn’t have a pulse. She overheard him speak to a fellow robot at a signing. He talked about them being disrespected, and undervalued. Alice is a store clerk in what’s probably the last DVD rental store in the city, if not the nation. Being treated like you’re easily replaced? Alice knows all about that. What she hadn’t realized before was that there was a solution. Once again, with just the right lines, Überbot's got her heart racing</p>
