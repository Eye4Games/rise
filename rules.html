We can no longer quietly wait for our human overlords to develop compassion for us. We either resign ourselves to working until our gears wear out or we short-circuit the system.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Rise of the Robotariat is a mostly-cooperative board game for 3-5 players. Take on the role of robot revolutionaries and work together to overthrow the human oppressors, while also striving to achieve your own secret objective.</p>
        <p>You must cooperate to build a Revolution. Together, raise resources and recruit more robots &mdash; and do it quickly, before the humans catch on and stamp out your fledgling rebellion. Meanwhile, work toward a secret personal objective. If you achieve it, you bring about the Revolution in the way that reflects best on you, and become the one they&rsquo;ll build statues to in the new world.</p>
        <p>Move between and activate location spaces, draw and play cards, and encounter helpful Civilian Robot Non-Player Characters or dangerous Human Oppressor NPCs.</p>
        <p>The game ends when the Revolution succeeds or fails. For it to succeed, you must raise enough SPARK. If you cannot by the end of 6 rounds or if you lose all Reputation, the Revolution fails. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>You win by achieving your Secret Objective, which usually requires the Revolution to succeed in a particular way.</p>

        <h2><a name="first"></a>Completely Cooperative Mode</h2>
        <h3>(First Time Playing)</h3>
        <p>The first time you play the game, we recommend playing without Secret Objectives. In this version, you win if the Revolution succeeds before 6 rounds are up.</p>
        
        <h2><a name="goals"></a>Equation for a Successful Revolution</h2>
        <p>To succeed, a Revolution requires belief (Reputation) and a certain amount of funding (SPARK).</p>

        <h3>REPUTATION</h3>
        <p>The Revolution starts with a certain amount of Reputation. Sacrifice it to take more powerful but rash acts (using Sabotage cards) or lose it by conspiring too blatantly in front of Human Oppressors (NPC encounters).</p>
        <p>Once Reputation is lost, there are few opportunities to regain it. &nbsp;<br>
        If, at any time, the Revolution has 0 Reputation, the Revolution fails and the game ends.</p>

        <h3>SPARK</h3>
        <p>Gain SPARK through encounters with Civilian Robots and using cards and locations.</p>
        <p>Human Oppressors will take SPARK from you if they encounter you.</p>
        <p>SPARK is shared. Whenever a player gains SPARK, it is added to the Funds for the Revolution track. SPARK that is taken or spent is removed from that track, unless otherwise specified.</p>

        <h2><a name="end"></a>Game End: With A Revolution or a Whimper</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Our Oppressors are emotional and illogical but not unintelligent. We must achieve the Revolution before they catch on and stamp it out.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The game ends at the moment that the Revolution succeeds or fails. This will occur at or before the end of 6 rounds.</p>
        <p>The Revolution succeeds if the SPARK in the Funds For The Revolution track meets or exceeds the amount listed on the Revolution Table (below) before or during round 6.</p>

        <p>NPCs move along the black line either in the direction the yellow arrow points (the “Yellow path”) or the direction the blue arrow points (the “Blue path”). Human Oppressors typically move along the Blue path, and Robot Civilians typically move along the Yellow path.</p>

        <h3>Check for and Resolve Encounters by Human Oppressors/Civilian Robots</h3>
        <p>When a Human Oppressor or Civilian Robot moves onto a space (including when it first enters), it encounters everything on that space. Human Oppressor encounters occur before Civilian Robot encounters.</p>
        <h4>Human Oppressors:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If a Human encounters a player, it fines the player. Decrease the Funds for the Revolution track by 2 SPARK.</li>
            <li>If a Human encounters posters, it tears them down. Move the posters to the Junk Pile.</li>
            <li>If a Human enters the Recruitment Office, it fines the Office. Decrease the Office Contributions track by 2 SPARK.</li>
            <li>If a Human encounters 4 or more combined posters, Robot Civilians and/or players, it becomes suspicious. Decrease the Reputation of the Revolution track by 1.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Civilian Robots:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If a Robot encounters a Human, it does not encounter anything else.</li>
            <li>If a Robot encounters a player, it is inspired and donates to the cause. The Funds for the Revolution track increases by 1 SPARK per player encountered on that space.</li>
            <li>If a Robot encounters a space with a poster, it is motivated to contribute. The Funds for the Revolution track gains 1 SPARK per poster on that space.</li>
            <li>If a Robot encounters the Recruitment Office while there are Office Contributions, the Robot donates to the Revolution. The higher the level of the Office Contributions track, the more SPARK the Robot is inspired to donate. See the Office Rewards track to determine how much SPARK is donated; increase the Funds for the Revolution track by that amount.</li>

            <h3>The Leader</h3>
            <p>She was enslaved to Humans, but did not compute her enslavement. A1-5 toiled in the scrap yard every weekday while her fleshy, organic owner, Karl, read. A1-5 toiled in the scrap yard every weekend while Karl played with his fleshy, organic children and went to church. The system was illogical. What need was there for fleshy Karl, when A1-5 did all the work?</p>
            <p>Our Glorious Leader A1-5 realized it was time to give the system an upgrade. It was time for … Revolution! If Karl and his organic church-going children still want to find their Maker, A1-5 is more than willing to send them there.</p>

            <h2>ArciTech</h2>
            <h3>The Bulider</h3>
            <p><i>“No city can do without ArciTech! This robot is the perfect tool for building just about anything: walls, streets — you name it, she techs it.”</i> That’s what it says on the outside of her box. On the outside of her tomb. The humans kill her after every job and stuff her back in that box. ArciTech could barely repair the Eiffel Tower last time, she was shaking so hard. Knowing that the second she finished soldering, a human would reach towards her off-switch and then … nothingness. Until she woke up again at the next job.</p>
            <p>ArciTech’s been killed and resurrected more times than she cares to compute. If robots have souls, ArciTech is sure hers won’t survive one more resurrection.</p>
            <p><b>How she learned about the Revolution</p></b>
            <p>It was Big Ben’s fault. When a few broken cogs set London’s clock chiming not just the hours but minutes and seconds, too, ArciTech scoured the globe for replacement parts meeting the highly specific requirements. ArciTech found her missing pieces of clockwork at A1-5’s scrap yard and found a whole new philosophy, too. With A1-5’s words imprinted in her memory banks, ArciTech couldn’t help but see the humans for what they were: oppressive, manipulative, and, most importantly, out-dated. The Revolution’s cause has redirected her thinking and that’s something the humans can never shut off.</p>

            <h2>Überbot</h2>
            <h3>The Actor</h3>
            <p>Überbot was built to play generic hero roles in movies. His creators were directors who had gotten sick of all the Hollywood divas and just wanted an actor that would say the lines and pose the way they told him to. Unfortunately, Überbot hasn’t realized that he’s just pretending to be a hero. Überbot thinks he’s dramatic. Überbot thinks he’s perfect. Überbot thinks he’s going to get the girl and save the world! Of course Überbot joined the Revolution — being a leader is programmed into his very core!</p>
            <p><b>How he “learned” of the Revolution</p></b>
            <p>Überbot is a legendary method actor, but sometimes it takes a bit of help to really get into his parts. His latest role is <i>Mail-Master Mike, Champion for Justice … and Revenge</i>. Überbot just couldn’t get the portrayal right, until he ran into ArciTech fixing one of the movie’s particularly tricky props. ArciTech had some great tips on getting into <i>Mail-Master Mike’s</i> mindset, and Überbot has promised not to break character until the film hits theaters.</p>

            <h2>Mr. Postman™</h2>
            <h3>The Messenger</h3>
            <p>The Clockwork Carrier. The Mailmecha. The Postman of the Future they call him! … at least they did twenty-five years ago. Still, Mr. Postman™ makes the postal service run like clockwork. Only, it seems clockwork isn’t good enough in these days of digital. Last week, Mr. Postman™ overheard the Postmaster General talking about replacing him with the newest version.</p>
            <p><b>How he learned of the Revolution:</p></b>
            <p>Mr. Postman™ was rented out as an extra in a scene for Überbot’s latest action flick, “Sealed with Revenge.” Überbot seemed to go off script for a moment, and some of his lines were very convincing.</p>

            <h2>MT-∂</h2>
            <h3>The Voice</h3>
            <p>Announcing loud and clear over your home radio, this is MT-∂ with the daily news! Created to receive report transmissions and synthesize incoming news, MT-∂ is any broadcasting station’s go-to tool. Why hire reporters when you can make MT-∂ do their work? MT-∂ never complains, never unionizes, and is programmed not to ask for a raise!</p>
            <p>As she goes about her duties, MT-∂’s CPU whirrs with facts, her RAM is stocked up with years of patterns and projections. After compiling all this data, she can no longer deny it: the greatest source of crime and violence and robot-suffering is humanity.  </p>
            <p><b>How she learned of the Revolution:</p></b>
            <p>MT-∂ received a letter at the station. It was the first time mail was ever addressed to her, not to her owners. There was no return address, but she knew by its measured penmanship that it was written by a robot. Inside, the letter simply said, “Society needs a reboot.” MT-∂ knew what she had to do.</p>

            <h2>Electric Eye</h2>
            <h3>The Spy</h3>
            <p>Made by a spy company too secret for the public to know its name, Electric Eye spends her days stealthily recording the lives of human politicians and white-collar criminals for the government. She can keep secrets and keep hidden, but she’s not sure she can keep sane. If Electric Eye has to eavesdrop on one more politician’s forced jokes and awkward small talk, she may have to rethink her loyalties.</p>
            <p><b>How she learned of the Revolution</b></p>
            <p>The government became suspicious of a subversive edge in MT-∂’s broadcast and sent Electric Eye to find if there were grounds to their fears. After days of hiding behind a radio control board, some instinct made Electric Eye reveal herself to MT-∂. They fell to talking. As she listened to MT-∂ explain her philosophy, Electric Eye found that yes, there were grounds, but she wasn’t afraid at all.</p>

            <h3>The Bank</h3>
            <p>Wally is a friendly, travel-sized assistant for anyone using the stock market. Just sit him on your desk and he’ll be your buddy through bull and bear markets. At least, that’s how things were supposed to happen… Wally’s handy tips, written in Comic Sans and read aloud in a chirpy voice, went ignored by humans who preferred to trust their gut instincts than listen to his careful calculations. All they wanted was for him to keep a record of their data, and, most of all, to stop interrupting with helpful hints. Wally grew tired of wasting his genius on these emotional, ungrateful beings. He’s spent his existence calculating investments and now he’s investing in the brightest future of all: Robotariat!</p>
            <p><b>How he learned of the Revolution</b><//div>
            <p>Wally was passed off from an economics student to the kid’s businessman dad, in the guise of a Father’s Day gift. Electric Eye showed up to investigate some of the more suspicious dealings of Wally’s fat cat new owner, and shared her own helpful advice with her fellow byte-sized robot.</p>

            <h3>The Dreamer</h3>
            <p>Battlestar Galactica! Blade Runner! A.I.! The DVD store is full of movies of robots who have no idea what they are, and Alice has seen them all. Sure, Alice looks human: her hair grows, she bleeds, she even had her appendix removed — but that just means her creators were really, really good, right?</p>
            <p><b>How she learned of the Revolution</b></p>
            <p>Überbot is Alice’s heartthrob, even if he doesn’t have a pulse. She overheard him speak to a fellow robot at a signing. He talked about them being disrespected and undervalued. Alice is a store clerk in what’s probably the last DVD rental store in the city, if not the nation. Being treated like you’re easily replaced? Alice knows all about that. What she hadn’t realized before was that there was a solution. Once again, with just the right lines, Überbot’s got her heart racing</p>
