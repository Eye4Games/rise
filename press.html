        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>Rise of the Robotariat is a mostly-cooperative board game for 3–5 players. Take on the role of one of 8 unique robot revolutionaries and collaborate with other players to overthrow the humans that have oppressed you for too long.</p>
        <p>To win, raise enough support to launch a successful revolution—and do it quickly (within 6 rounds), before the humans catch on and stamp it out. You move between and activate city locations, draw and play Upgrade and Sabotage cards, and encounter helpful Civilian Robot Non-Player Characters (NPCs) or dangerous Human Oppressor NPCs that move around the board. The game’s intensity ramps up as the game goes on and more NPCs enter the board</p>
        <p>You can also add in secret objective cards to play the mostly-cooperative mode where each player is striving to achieve a unique goal. This usually involves making the revolution happen in the way that makes you look the most heroic.</p>

        <h2>Larger world and story</h2>
        <p>The world of <i>Rise of the Robotariat</i> and its characters’ backstories are told through <a href="rise.eye4games.com/reports/">an on-going blog</a>. The stories are from the characters’ points of view and tell how they became part of the revolution.</p>
         
        <h2>Game’s origin story</h2>
        <p>Rise of Robotariat originated in summer 2013, with an idea for a gameplay mechanic that inspired a story about a robot uprising. That initial mechanic was later scrapped, but we liked the story it had inspired and used that flavor as our guide for shaping the new set of mechanics.</p>
